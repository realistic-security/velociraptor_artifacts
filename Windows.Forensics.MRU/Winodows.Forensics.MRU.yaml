    This artifact utilizes RECmd from Eric Zimmerman's Tools to analyze User Configuration and Activity, specifically focusing on Most Recently Used (MRU) items. The information is extracted from the LastVisitedPidlMRU__NTUSER.DAT.csv and OpenSavePidlMRU__NTUSER.DAT.csv output files.

    
    - It fetches the RECmd tool, available locally.

    - A temporary directory is created to store the extracted files.

    - NTUSER.DAT files are listed for each user on the client.

    - Sequential queries are executed for each user to extract CSV files containing their activities and configurations using RECmd.

    - The tool extracts information about the executable, absolute path, timestamp, and details of the binary that ran the opened file.

    - CSV files containing user activities and configurations are filtered to include only the 'LastVisitedPidlMRU__NTUSER.DAT.csv' and 'OpenSavePidlMRU__NTUSER.DAT.csv' files.

    - The final output includes details such as the executable, absolute path, timestamp, and additional information from the selected CSV files.
